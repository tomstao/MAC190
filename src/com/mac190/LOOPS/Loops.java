example:
1. int = 2;
2 int total =20;
3. while(i < 7) {
       Total = 2 * Total /3 - i;
       i+=3;
}

Q1. that is initialization here? int i =2 ;(and ay some extent int Total = 20;)
Q2. What is the condition i <7;
Q3: What are statements? Total = 2*Total /3 - i;
Q4. What is the increment? i+=3;
Q5. What is the value of Total at each iteration and at the end of the loop.
Trace the code:
first iteration: Total: 13,12. something 11. 11. something 14, 10. something.

1/ i -2
2. Total =20
3.while(2 < 7)
    4.Total = 2*20 /3 -2 = 40 /3 -2 = 13 -2 = 11
    5.i = 2+3=5
3. while (5<7) True
    4. Total - 2* 11/ 3 - 5 = 22/3 - 5 == 7-5 =2
    5. i = 5-3 = 2
3. while (8 <7 ) False. get out of the loop.

A for loop is another way of writing a while loop safely. Very often we forget initialize or increment,
 the for loop forces you to specify them,
 The previous loop would be written as follows using a for loop:
    int total = 20;
    for(int i = 2 ; i < 7; i+=3)
    {
        Total - 2 * Total - 9;
    }

   for(initialization)
   {
    statements.
   }

   do while loop always execute the statements once before check the conditions.
   do
   {
        statements;
   } while (conditions)

   do-while loops is used for instance if you want your program to run multiple times.
   You need it to run at least once.

   A for loop is generally used when you know exactly how many times the loop iterates.

   A while is generally used when we don't
